# ParT
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/kikofernandez/kpar.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/kikofernandez/kpar)

__PROTOTYPE__

ParT is a parallel collection designed to coordinate complex workflows
including but not limited to pipeline and speculative parallelism
(based on the [Encore Parallel combinators](http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-319-18941-3_1)
paper).

Asynchronous computations and values are _lifted_ to the ParT abstraction,
which can be controlled via the ParT combinators.
 
## Features

This library provides a function to *spawn*
asynchronus computations and these can be *lifted* into the ParT abstraction
via the `liftf` combinator.

A task is an asynchronous computation that happens
in other working thread but synchronous computations can be added to the
parallel collection as well via the `liftv` combinator. A spawned task
returns a `CompletableFuture` value.

The following example spawns a task and returns a parallel collection:

```
(defn computation
  [x]
  (let [t (spawn (inc x))]
    (liftf t))
```

Combinators provide high-level constructs for low-level management of the
elements in the parallel collection:

- `||` (read *par*), creates a new parallel collection given a bunch
of parallel collections:

```
(let [x1 (liftv (inc 1))
      x2 (liftv (dec 23))]
      (|| x1 x2))
```

- `>>` (read *sequence*), applies a function to each element in the
collection asynchronously.

```
(defn par-example
  [p]
  (p >> inc >> inc))
```

- `extract`, combinator that moves a parallel collection to the
sequential world, blocking until all the elements in the collection
have finished their computation and returning an array.

```
(defn extract-example
  []
  (let [x1 (liftv (inc 1))
        x2 (liftv (dec 100))
        p  (| x1 x2)]
    (extract p)))
```


## Usage

TODO: Examples

### ToDo

- ~~[Basic implementation of ParT](http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-319-18941-3_1) with combinators: `extract`, `||`, `liftf`, `liftv`, `>>`~~
- [Runtime optimisations with automatic scheduling decisions](http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-662-48096-0_19) for maximal throughput
- Memoize frequently used functions that are free of side-effects
- Add `<<` combinator, which tracks down and safely stops speculative parallelism
- Add more complex combinators

## Constraints

- Java 8
